    <h2>7.5/10</h2>
    <h3>Prawn curry is a very flavorful and delicious dish. I quite liked the way the prawns were cooked, they were tender and juicy. The curry had a coconut flavor to it and was spciy. It was very tasty and went well with the prawns. I paired it with white rice which dulled down the spice a little, but it was still a firey dish. I am not a huge fan of coconut, so I didn't love the curry, but nonetheless it was still a very flavorful dish. I would make recommend adding some vegetables to the curry to make it a little more healthy.</h3>
