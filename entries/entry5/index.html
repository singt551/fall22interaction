  <div id="content1">This was the healthiest pizza I have ever eaten and was still super tasty. I really enjoyed the tanginess of the marinara sauce with the diced chicken cubes and the creaminess of the shredded cheese. The fresh basil garnish really elevated the dish and gave it a nice taste. I had never eaten a cauliflower tortilla before, and it was good. Although, the dish tasted like a regular pizza, it didn't become crispy enough and was kind of soggy. Therefore, I would recommend leaving it in the oven for a little longer.</div>
