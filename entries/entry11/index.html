    <div id="content2">This dish was divine. The creaminess of the spagetti with the subtle hint of truffle was magical. The potatoes were seasoned to perfection. I really enjoyed the crispy garlic and parmasean on it after it has been baked. The spagetti could be made creamier, this would enrich the dish even more. The potatoes could have been cooked for a little longer- until they turned golden brown. However, overall, this dish was mouthwatering and really satisfied my craving for italian cuisine.</div>
