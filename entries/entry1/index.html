      data-hover="Pasta is a simple dish yet so complicated. The ingredients are very basic, tomoto paste, onions, ravioli, heavy cream, seasoning and vodka. The biggest challange in creating a dish like this is timing and technique.  The sauce itself was amazing. 
      The slightly burnt tomato pure made a huge difference in adding not only texture but flavor to the dish. The sauce itself was a right balance of tangy and creamy. The ravioli was a bit overcooked. Maybe reducing the cooking time and adding it to the sauce al dante is a better idea. 
      The truffle stuffing inside the ravioli did clash with the tanginess of the tomato but the cream in the sauce did help compliment both flavors. The dish would recieve a 7.5/10.">

        <ol>
          <li>In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium heat until just warm. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-4 minutes until onion is soft. Add garlic and cook 2 minutes more.</li>
          <li>While onions and garlic cook, crush canned tomato by hand and save their juice as well. Add tomato paste and crushed red pepper to onions and stir. Add crushed tomatoes and juice. Remove from heat and add vodka. Return to heat and simmer until sauce thickens and vodka cooks out. For a smoother sauce, you can substitute crushed tomatoes or tomato puree. I opted for a chunkier sauce.</li>
          <li>Add cream to sauce, season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook another 5-10 minutes, simmering gently, until sauce has darkened a little. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
          <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook ravioli according to package instructions if using store bought. Homemade ravioli will take about 5-7 minutes. Drain pasta, portion into bowls, top with sauce, basil, freshly grated parmesan and a little drizzle of olive oil.</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
