    <div id="content9">This dish took me back to the Middle East. The rich flavors of spice in the juicy, tender chicken, combined with the cool, crunchy lettuce and cucumbers, made my mouth water for more. This dish was extremely flavorful, healthy, and easy to make. The tortilla got a little hard and turned into a taco of some sorts, but this didn't impact the taste one bit, so maybe only warming the tortilla would make it wrap. Additionally, I would recommend adding some hot sauce to the wrap which will really add an element of heat to the dish, but this can be varied based on preference.</div>
